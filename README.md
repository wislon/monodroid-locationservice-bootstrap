monodroid-locationservice-bootstrap
===================================

Xamarin (Mono for Android) bootstrap application for quickly getting a simple location monitoring service up and running, and capturing location-based data.

This does the bare minimum, but feel free to fork it for your own use. And if there's something you don't like, then don't just throw rocks at it, but go ahead and fix it. I'm happy to look at pull requests that won't move it too far away from being a generic, base system that people can use to leverage their own projects.
